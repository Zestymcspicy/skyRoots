        <p class="px-4">There are many nations and various colors (and even direction) are used
        to signify the Thunders or Winds or Guiding Spirits, but agreement
        exists that they have power, influence, significance.  For Potawatomi,
        things always begin in the East, designated by the color White, and
        travel around the circle clockwise. East is Spring, birth, babyhood,
        beginnings. Look to the east when you begin your morning. Enter the
        arena at the east. In this game with white markers, like little
        children, there are more, but they can do less. South, shown with Red,
        is summer, "where the heat comes from," time of intense growth.
        Adolescence. West is Yellow for harvest and the lightning that
        accompanies autumn storms. Adulthood, maturity. A yellow line signifying
        West divides north from south in many depictions of the wheel. North is
        symbolized with black, sometimes blue. "Old Man Winter," wisdom, old
        age, and inevitably, death, but for the Potawatomis, that is not the
        end because like winter is always followed by spring, East newness
        always follows North's loss. This phenomenon is signified in the game
        by the ability to Restore markers that were lost. Winter was also
        traditionally the time for storytelling and playing games since getting
        out to work was difficult due to weather. In the game of Thunders, this
        theme of contrast and complement is conveyed on many levels. Look for
        things that have their opposites, and the balance that occurs when they
        begin to interact.</p>

        <p class="px-4">Thunder's board is made up of modular tiles that form together into
          "the Land" as the game is being played, then in the second half of
          the game, are taken apart one tile at a time until the Land is no
          more. This feature of waxing and waning (like the moon) is the
          first evidence of the life cycle theme of Thunders, drawn from the
          Nyew Jigwe'k or the four Directions, as known by my tribe,
          the Prairie Band Potawatomi. More information about the cultural
          aspects and inspiration for the Thunders game can be found
          in the Culture section elsewhere on this site.
